Mix together the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Beat the egg with the milk,
make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and whisk in the milk to make a thick smooth batter.
Beat in the melted butter, and gently stir in half the blueberries.

Heat a teaspoon of oil or small knob of butter in a large non-stick frying pan. Drop a large tablespoonful
of the batter per pancake into the pan to make pancakes about 7.5cm across. Make three or four pancakes at 
a time. Cook for about 3 minutes over a medium heat until small bubbles appear on the surface of each pancake, 
then turn and cook another 2-3 minutes until golden. Cover with kitchen paper to keep warm while you use up the 
rest of the batter. Serve with golden syrup and the rest of the blueberries.
